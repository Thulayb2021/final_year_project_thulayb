# Project Overview: Obesity Level Estimation Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive dashboard for estimating obesity levels using a semi-supervised machine learning approach with the objective of optimizing prediction accuracy. 

## Key Attributes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Applying K-Means clustering to extract meaningful patterns from the data.
- **Supervised Learning:** Training classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regession) using cluster enhanced features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using accuracy, precision recall and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizing obesity prediction through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Multiple Logistic Regression)
- **Data Visualization** (Power BI)

This repository contains code and models detailing the implementation process.
